# SharedWallet
- This project is an implementation of a shared wallet with allowances for different users.
- The owner of contract can manage the amount of withdrawals by other users.
- I used Ownable.sol contract from openZepplin library to implement ownership
- I used SafeMath.sol contract from openZepplin library to implement subttractions
- I override one of the functions in openZepplin library to change its functionality.
- events were used to notify the adding/removing money to/from contract and cahnging different accounts allowances
